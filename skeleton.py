# approaches are / aren't active.

# Trains a linear model on the provided data and labels, using the supplied learning rate.
# weights should store the per-feature weights of the learned linear regression.
# losses should store the sequence of MSE losses for each epoch of training, which you will then plot.

# Generates and saves plots of the training loss curves. Note that you can interpret losses as a matrix

# Part 1 . Implement batch gradient descent and experiment with different learning rates.

# Part 2 b Training with redundant feature removed.
